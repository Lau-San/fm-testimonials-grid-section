## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)

### What I learned

-   I learned a bit more about Sass. Mainly partials and modules.
-   I got more practice with CSS Grid and animations.

### Continued development

I'll keep learning Sass, since there's still a lot that I don't know about it.

### Useful resources

-   [Sass, BEM & Responsive Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4) - I'm learning Sass with this course.
